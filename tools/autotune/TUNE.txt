Recipes for poor man's tuning of MIOpen for MIGraphX with a docker
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Step #1 - Capture the convolution kernels with two steps:
   - Turn on MIOpen command logging:
     export MIOPEN_ENABLE_LOGGING_CMD=1

   - Turn off MIGraphX fusions:
     export MIGRAPHX_DISABLE_MIOPEN_FUSION=1

   NOTE: MIGraphX fusions need to be turned off because MIOpen library does
         not log fused convolutions.

   Make sure stderr files are captured somewhere since this is where the
   logfiles go.  One example of recording this with MIGraphX driver for resnet50
   is as follows:

   env MIOPEN_ENABLE_LOGGING_CMD=1 MIGRAPHX_DISABLE_MIOPEN_FUSION=1 \
      migraphx-driver perf resnet50i1.onnx 1> resnet50.stdout 2> resnet50.stderr

   As a practical example, passing "-e MIOPEN_ENABLE_LOGGING_CMD=1" and
   "-e MIGRAPHX_DISABLE_MIOPEN_FUSION=1" on docker runs seems to do what
   is necessary.  See ../scripts/run_ort_migraphx.sh as an example.

2. Harvest the MIOpen convolution operators into a script.

   process_logfile.sh - is an example script that does this for all *stderr files
                        it gets passed.  The output is saved in convolutions.log
